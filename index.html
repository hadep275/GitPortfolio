        <p>
            I'm a passionate web developer with a strong love for coding. I enjoy creating web applications and designing interactive user experiences. My skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various web development frameworks. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the great outdoors or reading a good book.
